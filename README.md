# Nina API documentation
I try to document things that I have used and needed for FOSS Warn.

## List of places
[listOfPlaces.txt](https://github.com/nucleus-ffm/nina-api-documentation/blob/main/listOfplaces.txt) contains all the places for which you can receive notifications from nina. This file is automatically updated every night. 

## Other sources for information
* [bund.dev](bund.dev) unofficial project where you can find documentation on programming interfaces of federal administrative services and information portals.
